This talk will give an overview of the WebGPU API that will provide modern features such as “GPU compute” on the Web as well as lower overhead access to GPU hardware and better, more predictable performance. This will allow for much more graphically intensive games on the Web and boost performance of frameworks like Tensorflow.js up to 10x.
